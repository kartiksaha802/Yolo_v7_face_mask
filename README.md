Collect and prepare the data: In this step, we  gathered a dataset of images (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection) containing people with and without masks.

Train the YOLO v7 model: Next, we  trained the YOLO v7 model on our dataset to detect faces and masks in images and videos. This step would involve using a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch to train the model.

Implement DeepSORT: After training the YOLO v7 model, we  implemented the DeepSORT algorithm to track the individuals in the video. The DeepSORT algorithm uses a combination of object detection and tracking to keep track of individuals in the video.

Build the project: Once the model and tracking algorithm are trained and implemented, we  build the project by combining the different components together. This would involve using a programming language such as Python to write the code that uses the trained model and tracking algorithm to detect and track faces in live video.
